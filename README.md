**Ada:

. Active Participation in Release Activities
	•	Observation: During the recent monthly release cycle, I noticed that you didn’t actively participate in release activities. This left other team members to take on additional tasks, which slightly delayed our timeline.
	•	Impact: Your limited involvement added extra pressure on your teammates during a critical phase, affecting both efficiency and morale.
	•	Suggestion:
	•	Actively engage in release activities by volunteering for tasks and supporting the team during these critical phases.
	•	If there are specific reasons for your limited participation (e.g., workload conflicts or unclear expectations), please communicate them so we can address them together.
2. Workload Distribution During Sprint Planning
	•	Observation: During multiple sprint planning sessions, I noticed that you picked up comparatively less work than other lead engineers. While others were committing to specific tasks, your workload appeared lighter in comparison.
	•	Impact: This imbalance resulted in fewer deliverables during those sprints, which affected our overall progress toward team goals.
	•	Suggestion:
	•	During sprint planning, aim to take ownership of a workload that aligns with your role and is comparable to your peers’ contributions.
	•	Proactively identify tasks where you can add value or assist others to ensure we meet sprint commitments as a team.
	•	If there are concerns about task complexity or bandwidth, raise them during planning so we can adjust priorities collaboratively.
3. Adopting Progress Over Perfection
	•	Observation: At times, I’ve noticed that you prioritize perfection in others’ activities or deliverables, which has occasionally led to conflicts within the team. While striving for high standards is important, balancing this with a focus on progress and collaboration is equally crucial. Additionally, communication around these expectations could be improved to foster a more positive environment.
	•	Impact: This approach can slow down progress and create tension within the team when expectations are perceived as overly rigid or when feedback isn’t delivered in a constructive manner.
	•	Suggestion:
	•	Embrace a “progress over perfection” mindset by focusing on iterative improvements rather than expecting flawless outcomes from the start.
	•	Provide feedback in a polite and constructive way that encourages collaboration and growth without creating unnecessary friction.
	•	Build stronger relationships with team members by recognizing their efforts and fostering open communication.



Vanita:
1. Initial Design and Technical Understanding
	•	Observation: It seems that a lack of thorough initial design and technical understanding contributed to challenges, such as bugs, performance issues, and the need for code rewrites.
	•	Impact: This led to delays in delivery timelines and required additional effort to fix issues that could have been avoided with more robust planning.
	•	Suggestion:
	•	Invest more time upfront in understanding the requirements and creating a detailed design plan before starting implementation.
	•	Collaborate with peers or senior team members to review designs and validate technical approaches early in the process.
	•	Don’t hesitate to ask questions or raise concerns during the planning phase if something is unclear or seems risky.
2. Testing Practices for Feature Delivery
	•	Observation: Quick feature delivery resulted in limited testing, which led to undetected bugs and performance issues post-release.
	•	Impact: This affected the overall quality of the product and required additional effort for debugging and optimization after deployment.
	•	Suggestion:
	•	Allocate sufficient time for testing as part of your development workflow. Ensure that unit tests, integration tests, and performance checks are completed before marking a feature as done.
	•	Consider writing automated tests where applicable to ensure consistent coverage and reduce manual effort in future iterations.
	•	Collaborate with QA (or peers) early on to identify potential edge cases or scenarios that need attention during testing.
Moving Forward
To address these challenges:
	1.	Let’s focus on improving planning and design processes by involving stakeholders early and ensuring alignment on requirements and technical feasibility.
	2.	Make testing an integral part of your workflow by incorporating it into your definition of done for every task or feature you work on.
	3.	If you encounter constraints (time, resources, or otherwise) that may affect quality, please raise them proactively so we can find solutions together as a team.


Zanaya:

* 1. Technical Understanding and Delivery Process
* 	•	Observation: On a few instances, the delivery timeline was impacted due to less technical understanding of certain areas and gaps in the delivery process.
* 	•	Impact: These delays affected our ability to meet business expectations, which had a direct impact on our stakeholders.
* 	•	Suggestion:
* 	•	Take time to deepen your understanding of the technical aspects of the features you’re working on by leveraging resources such as documentation, training, or peer collaboration.
* 	•	Collaborate with senior team members or subject matter experts early in the development cycle to clarify technical requirements or address any uncertainties.
* 	•	Consider breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces to ensure steady progress while addressing technical gaps incrementally.
* 2. Development Practices in React (ZL Retry Development)
* 	•	Observation: During the ZL retry development, there was a delay due to gaps in React development practices. This was compounded by the fact that significant effort had already been spent on DC1 UI features and changes.
* 	•	Impact: The lack of familiarity with React best practices contributed to slower progress, which ultimately impacted project timelines.
* 	•	Suggestion:
* 	•	Dedicate time to improving your React development skills by exploring best practices, tutorials, or online courses to strengthen your expertise in this area.
* 	•	Pair program with teammates who have more experience in React to learn from their approaches and gain hands-on exposure to advanced techniques.
* 	•	Proactively seek feedback on your implementation during code reviews to identify areas for improvement and apply those learnings in future tasks.
* Moving Forward
* To address these challenges:
* 	1.	Let’s create a learning plan that focuses on improving your technical skills in areas like React and delivery processes. I’m happy to recommend resources or connect you with team members who can mentor you in these areas.
* 	2.	During upcoming planning sessions, let’s work together to identify tasks where you can apply these learnings while balancing your workload effectively so that timelines are not impacted.
* 	3.	Proactively communicate if you encounter challenges during development so we can address them early and avoid delays.
