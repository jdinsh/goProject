Thank you for providing the additional details that there are six microservices in the document-sharing app, and each should be assigned to a lead engineer for technical delivery. You’ve also specified that:
One lead engineer oversees the OCP (OpenShift Container Platform) migration for all microservices (Spring Boot, Apigee, MongoDB) and UI components (Angular 17).

One lead engineer handles both Application Availability and parallèleApplication Error Handling as their NFR hard gate responsibilities.

All six lead engineers must improve their skills in OCP and GitHub Actions.

Two engineers focus on data migration for the MongoDB database.

The team consists of six lead engineers (1 UI engineer, others with backend, DevOps, or full-stack focus) and 2 junior engineers, working with Angular 17, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Apigee, and the Orchestra framework.

I’ll revise the SMART goals to assign each of the six microservices to a lead engineer for technical delivery, incorporate the OCP migration oversight, combined Availability and Error Handling NFR, data migration, and skill improvement in OCP and GitHub Actions. The goals are tailored for year-end review by Q4 2025.
Updated Context
Tech Stack: Angular 17 (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), MongoDB (database), Apigee (API management), Orchestra (internal framework).

Team: 6 lead engineers and 2 junior engineers.

Microservices: 6 microservices, each assigned to one lead engineer for technical delivery. Since the app is a document-sharing platform, I’ll assume the microservices cover key functionalities (e.g., document management, user management, API gateway, etc.). If you provide specific microservice names or purposes, I can refine the assignments.

OCP Migration: One engineer (Lead Engineer 4, DevOps) oversees the migration of all microservices and UI components to OpenShift, while others contribute to their assigned services.

Data Migration: Two engineers (Lead Engineers 2 and 4) handle MongoDB data migration to OCP-hosted instances.

NFR Hard Gates:
Application Alerting

Application Availability + Application Error Handling (combined for one engineer)

Application Auditability (split into UI and backend)

Application Performance Testing

Skill Improvement: All engineers must improve skills in OCP (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenShift Pipelines) and GitHub Actions (e.g., CI/CD workflows).

Previous Roles (adjusted for six engineers):
Lead Engineer 1: UI Engineer (Angular 17, NFR: Auditability - UI)

Lead Engineer 2: Backend Engineer (Spring Boot/MongoDB, NFR: Performance Testing, Data Migration)

Lead Engineer 3: Backend Engineer (Spring Boot/Apigee, NFR: Availability + Error Handling)

Lead Engineer 4: DevOps Engineer (OCP/Infrastructure, NFR: Alerting, Data Migration, OCP Migration Oversight)

Lead Engineer 5: Full-Stack Engineer (UI/Backend, NFR: Auditability - Backend)

Lead Engineer 6: Backend Engineer (Spring Boot/MongoDB, NFR: Support Role)

Microservice Assignments
Since you mentioned six microservices but didn’t specify their names or functions, I’ll assume a logical breakdown for a document-sharing app and align them with the engineers’ roles:
Document Management Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB): Handles document CRUD operations, storage, and retrieval.

User Management Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB): Manages user authentication, authorization, and profiles.

Search Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB): Provides document search and indexing capabilities.

API Gateway Service (Apigee/Spring Boot): Manages external API integrations and routing.

Collaboration Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB): Supports real-time collaboration and versioning.

Frontend Service (Angular 17): Delivers the UI for document sharing and interaction.

Each microservice is assigned to one lead engineer for technical delivery, ensuring they own development, testing, and integration for their service.
Revised Role and NFR Assignments
To accommodate six microservices, the combined Availability and Error Handling NFR, OCP migration oversight, and data migration, the assignments are:
Lead Engineer 1: Frontend Service (Angular 17), NFR: Auditability - UI

Lead Engineer 2: Document Management Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB), NFR: Performance Testing, Data Migration

Lead Engineer 3: API Gateway Service (Apigee/Spring Boot), NFR: Availability + Error Handling

Lead Engineer 4: No direct microservice (oversees OCP migration and infrastructure), NFR: Alerting, Data Migration, OCP Migration Oversight

Lead Engineer 5: Collaboration Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB), NFR: Auditability - Backend

Lead Engineer 6: User Management Service (Spring Boot/MongoDB), NFR: Support Role (no direct NFR, supports migration and delivery)

Note: Lead Engineer 4 focuses on OCP migration oversight and infrastructure, so they don’t own a specific microservice but ensure all services are migrated. If you prefer Lead Engineer 4 to own a microservice (e.g., a monitoring service), let me know.

Implementation Notes
Microservice Assignments: Each engineer owns one microservice for technical delivery, except Lead Engineer 4, who focuses on OCP migration oversight and infrastructure. If you provide specific microservice names or purposes (e.g., “Notification Service” instead of Collaboration), I can refine assignments.

OCP Migration Oversight: Lead Engineer 4 coordinates migration across all six microservices, ensuring containerization and deployment. Other engineers align their service migrations with Lead Engineer 4’s plan.

Data Migration: Lead Engineer 2 handles MongoDB data migration logic, while Lead Engineer 4 manages infrastructure, both under Lead Engineer 4’s OCP oversight.

NFR Coverage: Lead Engineer 3 combines Availability and Error Handling. Auditability is split (Lead Engineer 1: UI, Lead Engineer 5: backend). Lead Engineer 6 supports without a direct NFR to balance workload.

Skill Improvement: All engineers complete OCP and GitHub Actions training by Q3 2025, applying skills in CI/CD pipelines and migration tasks. Lead Engineer 4’s workshop reinforces team-wide learning.

Mentorship: Each junior is mentored by 3 leads (e.g., Lead Engineers 1, 3, 5 for one; 2, 4, 6 for the other) to cover UI, backend, and DevOps skills. Adjust if needed.

Tracking: Use Jira for tasks, OpenShift’s Prometheus/Grafana for NFR metrics, and Elasticsearch for logs. Conduct quarterly reviews to track OCP/GitHub Actions skills and SMART goals.

Orchestra Framework: Assumed to provide logging, security, and CI/CD standards. If it has specific OCP or GitHub Actions tools, share details for integration.

If you provide microservice names, data migration specifics (e.g., data volume), or want to adjust NFRs or mentorship, I can refine further. Would you like me to search for best practices on OCP migration for microservices or GitHub Actions workflows for Spring Boot/Angular?
